bake [-chln] [-s <n>] <FILENAME> [ARGS...]; version 20240930

Bake is a simple tool meant  to execute embedded shell commands within
any file.   It executes with /bin/sh  the command after a  "@BAKE " to
the end of the line (a UNIX newline: '\n') or to the first instance of
@STOP.

It expands some macros,
  @FILENAME @FILE @NAME - filename
  @SHORT                - filename without suffix (abc.x.txt \-> abc.x)
  @SHORT:N              - removes N suffixes, so (a.b.c 2 -> a)
  @ARGS                 - other arguments to the program
  @ARGS:N               - Provides the Nth argument, starting from 0
  @ARGS:N+              - All arguments at and after Nth
  @RECURS               - the full path name to the executable
  @LINE                 - line number at the selected @BAKE

All  macros  can be  exempted  by  prefixing  them with  a  backslash,
which'll be subtracted in the  expansion. commands may be spanned over
several lines with a leading backslash.

Shake

Bake was inspired by the  Bash-based Shake utility (formerly eMake, he
liked my suggestion  for a name).  It is  included under authorization
of  its creator.   The  original version  of Shake  may  be found  at:
<http://bis64wqhh3louusbd45iyj76kmn4rzw5ysawyan5bkxwyzihj67c5lid.onion/anon/shake>

Bake  includes a  modified Shake,  both  after installation  and as  a
bootstrapper.  The modified version includes all features of Bake with
the  exceptions  of   multi-line  commands.   It  is   not  a  general
replacement for Bake.

Shake doesn't support multi-line commands.

Changelog

Bake was created on 2023/09/13, and complete as of 2024/03/02.

2024-09-27

Lex. As adviced  by the original creator, I learned  and implemented a
Bake with lex. It's fully featured, and has new stuff.

2024-10-24 - Awake

Egor (some dead guy) made a AWK implementation of Bake, it's POSIX.
It doesn't support multi-line, expunge, parses options after filename,
or changing directory to file's directory - it's compatible with Bake
otherwise.

 cd /dir/of/file; awake file

See ./awake --help
